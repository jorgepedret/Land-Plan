Requirements:
*if you're on mac and get an error about java you need to have a Java Runtime Environment or JRE.  Go online and search for the newest one.  Download and install it.

*LibreOffice version 7.3.5.2 and 7.2.7.2 work on linux.  other versions may give the error: The connection to the data source “LANdpLAN.odb” could not be established.  error in script file line 1 Unexpected token  UNIQUE, requires COLLATION in statement [SET DATABASE UNIQUE] ./connectivity/source/drivers/jdbc/Object.cxx:175

﻿*You must change the macro security settings in Libreoffice:
	Open LibreOffice and got to:
	>Tools>Options>LibreOffice>Security>Macro Security...>Medium

*32bit linux computers* will crash unless you add a boot parameter to the kernel by:
	From a terminal (or after pressing Alt + F2) run:
	gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub
	(or use sudo nano if gksudo or gedit are not available) and enter your password.
	Find the line starting with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT and append stack_guard_gap=1 to its end. For example:
	GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash stack_guard_gap=1"
	Save the file and close the editor.
	Finally, start a terminal and run:
	sudo update-grub
	to update GRUB's configuration file (you probably need to enter your password).
	On the next reboot, the kernel should be started with the boot parameter. To permanently remove it, simply remove the parameter from GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT and run sudo update-grub again.
	To verify your changes, you can see exactly what parameters your kernel booted with by executing cat /proc/cmdline.

*Open up the LANdpLAN.odb file.

*you need to tell the databse where the files are:  Go to Edit>Database>Properties: and change the file address to reflect your setup
  for example:
  hsqldb:file:////home/jonathan/Dropbox/LANdpLAN/LANdpLAN/mydb;default_schema=true;shutdown=true;hsqldb.default_table_type=c
  becomes
  hsqldb:file:////home/workaway/Dropbox/LANdpLAN/LANdpLAN/mydb;default_schema=true;shutdown=true;hsqldb.default_table_type=c


*to add images: to the Drawing>Plant_images>images folder.  Name them using caps for the first letter of each Genus, species with no spaces, ".jpg" at the end and ascending numbers if there are mor than one like GenusSpecies.jpg, GenusSpecies.jpg2, GenusSpecies.jpg3
next use the file browser and opne the folder Drawing>Plant_images>images
select all and copy.  (this copies all of the file paths in the folder)
open aaaimages.ods
select column A on Sheet1 and paste.
on Sheet2 select all
go to Tables inthe LANdpLAN databse and delete "images"
click and drag the selcetion on sheet two to the Table window in the LANdpLAN database.
Givethe name "images", select definition and data, next> move all, next> right click ID select "Primary Key", change Field Type to "Integer", Create


*********************************************************************************
*If you create a new Table you will need to:

1)
use Tools > SQL... to add the AutoValue function to your Primary Key column as shown below...
replacing the TableName and ColumnName with your own:

ALTER TABLE "TableName" ALTER COLUMN "ColumnName" INTEGER IDENTITY;

for example:
ALTER TABLE "Availability" ALTER COLUMN "ID" INTEGER IDENTITY;
or
ALTER TABLE "beds" ALTER COLUMN "bed_id" INTEGER IDENTITY;
or
ALTER TABLE "plants" ALTER COLUMN "plant_id" INTEGER IDENTITY;
or
ALTER TABLE "Plots" ALTER COLUMN "plot_id" INTEGER IDENTITY;
or
ALTER TABLE "images" ALTER COLUMN "ID" INTEGER IDENTITY;

This will update the table but you'll need to click: View > Refresh Tables to see the change in the Base GUI. 

2)
If the id or ID field is not auto incrementing the way it should, then you can fix this by:

A)ALTER TABLE 'YOURTABLENAME' ALTER COLUMN 'YOURCOLUMNNAME' SET GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY

ex:
ALTER TABLE 'Availability' ALTER COLUMN 'ID' SET GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY
or
ALTER TABLE 'beds' ALTER COLUMN 'bed_id' SET GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY
or
ALTER TABLE 'plants' ALTER COLUMN 'plant_id' SET GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY
or
ALTER TABLE 'plots' ALTER COLUMN 'plot_id' SET GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY
or
ALTER TABLE 'images' ALTER COLUMN 'ID' SET GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY

B)Next get the highest value already in use in the table and add 1 to that for use in the next statement:

ALTER TABLE 'YOURTABLENAME' ALTER COLUMN 'YOURCOLUMNNAME' RESTART WITH XXX

ex:
ALTER TABLE 'Availability' ALTER COLUMN 'ID' RESTART WITH 11216
or
ALTER TABLE 'beds' ALTER COLUMN 'bed_id' RESTART WITH 231
or
ALTER TABLE 'plants' ALTER COLUMN 'plant_id' RESTART WITH 3222
or
ALTER TABLE 'Plots' ALTER COLUMN 'plot_id' RESTART WITH 65
or
ALTER TABLE 'images' ALTER COLUMN 'ID' RESTART WITH 440

where XXX = that highest value + 1.

here is a list of the table views in case you need to replace a table that depends on them:
 6 annual_cultivation_dates_view
 1 annual_cultivation_practices_calculated_view
 3 plot_annual_cultivation_dates_view
 2 plot_annual_cultivation_practices_calculated_view
 4 view_growers_annaul_cultivation_practices
 5 view_p_a_c_p_    plot_annual_cultivation_practices
